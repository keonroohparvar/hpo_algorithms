Hyperparameter Optimization Algorithm Implementations.

This github contains a Google Colab notebook where the implementation for the Random Search, Grid Search, and Bayesian Optimization algorithms can be found. These algorithms were implemented from scratch, only using Keras for the Neural Networks, and Numpy for some of the arithmetic needed.

It is highly reccomended you view the project on Colab, as you will be able to run the code cells.
